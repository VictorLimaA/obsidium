Obsidium is a software, deploy-ready for easily managing Part Number (PN) ordering and with aeronautics market standard definitions.
It was designed for use by an intermediate entity (Concentrator) that receives and concentrates the demands of customers (Operators), and sends to the contractor (Supplier). Processes orders, and covers different standard modalities in the aeronautical industry, such as:
- Components controlled by serial numbers, often served by means of repair;
- Immediate exchange items (shelf items), consumable or replaceable type;
- Call times as required by the Operator: Aircraft on Ground (AOG), RUSH (normal request), request for scheduled inspections, etc.;
- Status division of each request for segregation between internal sectors in the Concentrator;
- Division between payment models: Payment by Flight Time (HV) or payment by demand;
- Automatic control of dates, aircraft, operators, customizable as needed (conts.py files);
- Segregation between single treatment components: dangerous load, large load, or long Turn Around Time (TAT);
- Registration of items and prices;
- Concentrator aid with price display, automatic calculation of total purchase value, and pdf emission for orders to Supplier;
- Generation of monthly report of Supplier delivery metrics;
- Additional fields for delivery control: Tax Note, Delivery Date;
- Functionality of issue of intermediate documents: repair order and acquisition order;
- Export data in xlsx.
